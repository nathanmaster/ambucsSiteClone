Early history of the club shows involvement with Altoona Community Chest (United Way), sponsorship of a handicap Boy Scout Troop, gifts to the Altoona and Mercy Hospitals, and the establishment of the Easter Seals Society.  Today, the efforts of the Altoona AMBUCS continue to serve those in need.  Since 1994, our chapter has distributed over 175 AmTrykes to children and adults.  These unique therapeutic tricycles, which can be hand and\/or foot operated, are designed to accommodate riders of all ages, sizes, and varying degrees of physical limitations.  The AmTrykes are provided without charge through funds raised by the membership. The Altoona AMBUCS lead the efforts to build the first handicap-accessible playground in our community at the Easter Seals of Central Pennsylvania so that the children of our community could participate in the fun that many of us take for granted.  Our chapter has also answered the call to build ramps to access homes when steps become a challenge.<br ><br >Since 1955, the Altoona Chapter of AMBUCS has participated in our national Scholarships for Therapists program by donating over $100,000 to the education of students in the field of physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech pathology, and audiology.  One scholarship can go a long way, as the clinical practitioner spends a lifetime working with a community of people with disabilities.<br ><br >In addition, The Altoona Chapter of AMBUCS has made numerous charitable contributions totaling over $100,000 to our community which has supported organizations such as the Miracle League of Blair County, Dreams Go On, ARC of Blair County, and We Care.<\/p><\/div> <\/div> <div  class=\"row\"> <div  class=\"button-holder space-bottom space-bottom-small\" data-type=\"column\"> <\/div> <div  class=\"col-xs bottom-xs flexbox image-group-bottom-3-img space-bottom-xs center-xs\"> <img  decoding=\"async\" class=\"left-img shadow-large-black\" data-size=\"500x300\" src=\"http:\/\/ambucs.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/cropped-AE2BA9CDE45D4372986638F045C6FA5B-1.jpg\" title=\"cropped-AE2BA9CDE45D4372986638F045C6FA5B-1.jpg\" alt=\"\"> <img  decoding=\"async\" class=\"center-img shadow-large-black\" data-size=\"500x300\" src=\"http:\/\/ambucs.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/cropped-8A0FC6A53DD64F4788D35EC9922D5EBC-1.jpg\" title=\"cropped-8A0FC6A53DD64F4788D35EC9922D5EBC-1.jpg\" alt=\"\"> <img  decoding=\"async\" class=\"right-img shadow-large-black\" data-size=\"500x300\" src=\"http:\/\/ambucs.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/cropped-6D6AAF933ED841EEBC76B756C85A1FA7-1.jpg\" title=\"cropped-6D6AAF933ED841EEBC76B756C85A1FA7-1.jpg\" alt=\"\"><\/div> <\/div><\/div> <\/div><div  data-label=\"Donations\" data-id=\"content--1\" data-export-id=\"content-12\" data-category=\"content\" class=\"content-12 content-section content-section-spacing\" id=\"donations\" style=\"background-color: rgb(245, 250, 253);\"><div  class=\"gridContainer\"> <div  class=\"row text-center\"><div  class=\"section-title-col\" data-type=\"column\"> <h2  class=\"\">Donations<\/h2> <p  class=\"lead\">Donations wording goes here&#8230;<\/p><\/div> <\/div> <div  class=\"row center-xs middle-xs\"> <div  class=\"col-sm-9\" data-type=\"column\"> <\/div> <\/div><\/div> <\/div><div  id=\"contact\" data-label=\"Contact\" data-id=\"contact-1\" data-export-id=\"contact-1\" data-category=\"contact\" class=\"contact-1 content-section content-section-spacing white-text\" data-parallax-depth=\"20\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;http:\/\/ambucs.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/ContactUSEdited.png&quot;); background-size: cover; background-position: center top;\"><div  class=\"\"> <div  class=\"row text-center\"><div  class=\"section-title-col\" data-type=\"column\"> <h2  class=\"\">\n<br ><br >Contact us<\/h2> <p  class=\"lead\">\n\n<br ><br >Address: 651 Hillside View Drive<br >Duncansville, PA 16635<br >Phone: 814-695-6753<\/p><img  decoding=\"async\" class=\"custom-image\" src=\"http:\/\/ambucs.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/AMBUCS-500px-3.png\" title=\"AMBUCS 500px\" alt=\"\"><\/div> <\/div> <div  class=\"row text-center\"> <div  class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 contact-form-wrapper inline-info\"> <div  class=\"card large-padding\"> <div  class=\"\" data-content-shortcode=\"mesmerize_contact_form shortcode=&quot;Remove later&quot;\" data-editable=\"true\">[Remove later]<\/div> <\/div><\/div> <\/div><\/div>        <\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Scholarships More than $8 million in scholarships have been awarded by AMBUCS to therapy students pursuing degrees in physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech pathology, and audiology.Ambucs National Scholarships Page AmTrykes Every child deserves to experience the fun and freedom of riding a bike.
